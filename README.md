# Superstore Sales Dashboard (Tableau Project)

## Goal
This project analyzes Superstore sales data to identify unprofitable products, regions, and customer behaviors, and to propose actionable business recommendations.

The analysis was conducted in Tableau and divided into three parts:
1. Product performance
2. Regional profitability and advertising planning
3. Product return patterns

## Key Insights

### 📦 Part 1 — Product Profitability
- The most profitable **subcategory + region** combination is **Copiers in the West**.
- The biggest loss-maker is **Binders in the Central** region.
- The **most profitable product + ship mode** combo is `TEC-CO-10004722` (Copiers), while the biggest loss comes from `OFF-BI-10004995` (Binders).
- Sub-categories like **Copiers**, **Phones**, and **Accessories** bring the most profit, while **Tables**, **Bookcases**, and **Supplies** lead to losses.
- A separate chart highlights **unprofitable products** — these should potentially be removed from the catalog.

### 📍 Part 2 — Advertising Strategy
- Top-performing states in terms of **monthly profit**:
  - **New York** (highest in **September**)
  - **Washington** (peak in **March**)
  - **California** (strong returns in **August** and **December**)
- A proposed advertising budget is based on **⅕ of monthly profit** for these peak periods:
  - New York, September — **$2000**
  - Washington, March — **$1000**
  - California, August — **$1000**
  - California, December — **$1000**

### 🔁 Part 3 — Returns Analysis
- The highest **return rate** is observed in the **Machines** category (up to **35%**).
- Some individual customers return almost every purchase — raising concerns about profitability and fraud risk.
- A combined chart of **Return Rate vs. Average Profit** shows:
  - Copiers are not only the most profitable but also have a low return rate — a strong candidate for growth focus.
- Two key business issues were identified:
  1. Certain products consistently result in significant losses.
  2. Some customers return too frequently and impact margins.
